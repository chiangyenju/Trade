001
連續買入因更新較差的停損點，導致整個部位被洗出，可優化


002
RSI < 40 即使條件成立，買入依然容易停損出場
往下貫穿中布林壓縮大量停利空間

    # c1 日線收在下布林
    # c2 本Ｋ為綠Ｋ 前一天為紅Ｋ
    # c3 量大於前日
    # c4 收盤大於前日開盤 (discard)
    # c5 買入當下 RSI > 40

交易質量好但交易量太少


007
標準多頭排列，走勢交易，回報率高
    - KD 任意交叉即進場，較向下或向下交叉優
    - 停損設收盤價 Close 再判定停損，較直接以打到停損價格出場，獲利好很多
    - sl atr 3 > 5
    - tp atr 6 > 4

- Stop loss should be executed only after the candle is closed, to prevent being stopped by high or low values
Store stop loss as a variable, when candle closed, if close price < stop loss, close position using market price

- Try waiting until price closes for taking profits too. If closed price > 4 * atr. Take profit according to previous close price.
(After back test, especially including bear markets, it's better to just set take profit, instead of waiting for close price)

- When price reached LONG stop loss, LONG position was closed, LONG SL order + SHORT SL order + SHORT TP order were all closed.
Only LONG position TP order remains

- 007 KD 交叉不要限制 k > d or k < d
